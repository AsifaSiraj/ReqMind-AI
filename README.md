# ReqMind-AI
ReqMind AI is an AI-powered requirement analysis system built for the HEC Generative AI Training – Cohort 2 Hackathon (Jan–Feb 2026). It uses Large Language Models to extract functional and non-functional requirements, detect ambiguities, identify missing information, generate clarification questions, and produce structured JSON and PDF outputs.
